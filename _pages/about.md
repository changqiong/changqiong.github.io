I am an assistant professor at Institute of Science Tokyo (formerly Tokyo Institute of Technology), School of Computing. I received Ph.D. in Intelligent systems engineering from the University of Tsukuba. Before joining Science Tokyo, I was a researcher at the National Institue of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST).
