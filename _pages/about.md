I am an assistant professor at the [Tokyo Institute of Technology(TiTech)](https://www.titech.ac.jp/english) [School of Computing](https://www.titech.ac.jp/english/about/organization/schools/organization04). I received Ph.D. in Intelligent systems engineering from [University of Tsukuba](https://www.tsukuba.ac.jp/). Before joining TiTech, I was a researcher at [National Institue of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST)](https://www.aist.go.jp/index_en.html).
