I am an assistant professor at [School of
Computing](https://www.titech.ac.jp/english/about/organization/schools/organization04),
[Tokyo Institute of Technology](https://www.titech.ac.jp/english). I received
Ph.D. in Intelligent systems engineering from [University of
Tsukuba](https://www.tsukuba.ac.jp/). Before joining TITECH, I was an researcher
at [National Institue of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology
(AIST)](https://www.aist.go.jp/index_en.html).

Research Interests 
===== 
* General-Purpose computing on Graphics Processing Units (GPGPU): a methodology for high-performance computing that uses graphics
processing units to crunch data.
*  Real-Time vision system: accelerating the processing of high complexity vision algorithms using special hardwares such as FPGAs and GPUs.
*  High-performance large-scale data processing: efficient algorithms for large-scale data processing.
