I am an assistant professor at the Institute of Science Tokyo (formerly Tokyo Institute of Technology), School of Computing. I received my Ph.D. in Intelligent Systems Engineering from the University of Tsukuba. Before joining the Institute of Science Tokyo, I was a researcher at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST).


## Research Interests

* **GPU accelerators**: Kernel designs for high-performance computing that leverage GPUs for large-scale data processing.
* **Hardware-aware 3D vision systems**: Accelerating complex computer vision algorithms using hardware such as FPGAs and GPUs.
* **High-performance computing for large-scale data**: Efficient algorithms and systems for large-scale graph and data processing.
