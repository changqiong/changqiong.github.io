I am an assistant professor at Institute of Science Tokyo (formerly Tokyo Institute of Technology), School of Computing. I received Ph.D. in Intelligent systems engineering from the University of Tsukuba. Before joining Science Tokyo, I was a researcher at the National Institue of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST).

Research Interests 
======
* GPU Accelerator: kernel designs for high-performance computing that uses graphics processing units to crunch data.
* Real-time vision system: accelerating the processing of high complexity vision algorithms using special hardware such as FPGAs and GPUs.
* High-performance large-scale data processing: efficient algorithms for large-scale data processing.
